# Personal Portfolio WebsitePersonal Portfolio Website

## Description:

A modern, ambient-styled portfolio built with Next.js and TailwindCSS to showcase who I am and what I build. It features a fully custom About Me page, scroll-animated timeline, and a Projects page with dynamic modals for each project. There's also a sleek Contact page that sends real emails to my professional inbox using Nodemailer.

I focused on minimal, animated UI with smooth transitions, animated blobs, and full light/dark theme support. Everything's mobile-friendly, with responsive layouts and interactive touches.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
